# scRNA-seq Analysis using Seurat (PBMC)

## Objective
To perform a basic single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Seurat, including
quality control, clustering, and marker gene identification.

## Dataset
PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) single-cell RNA-seq dataset
provided by the SeuratData package.

## Tools
- R
- Seurat

## Scope and Note
This project is an academic learning exercise focused on understanding
the basic concepts and standard workflow of single-cell RNA-seq analysis
using Seurat. The analysis is intended for educational and demonstration
purposes.

## Status
Status: QC completed (mitochondrial filtering applied).
